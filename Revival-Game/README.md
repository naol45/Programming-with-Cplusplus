Imagine, you are the prince/princess of a magical kingdom named Aurelia. Your kingdom was attacked by a witch, and the 5 most powerful unicorns of your kingdom−Scarlet Comet, Sunshine Speedster, Ocean Dreamer, Forest Whisperer and Stardust Knight; were cursed and frozen by her. You, as the prince/princess of Aurelia, are on a mission to bring them back to life. Only once when all five of them are revived and they create the magical rainbow with each of their favorite colors, the magic of Aurelia will be back. This is a game that does that.
