In Old School Runescape, to gain money and advance combat levels players can get tasks to kill monsters from slayer masters. Players start getting tasks from slayer master Turael, but move on to unlocking slayer masters Duradel and Konar as they advance their combat and slayer levels. This is  a program to read a player's combat and slayer levels and what slayer master they want to do, then output a table of the tasks the player may get assigned based on their combat and slayer level.
