Combat Damage Calculator ⚔️
This is a C++ command-line tool that calculates attack damage based on a chosen combat style (Melee or Magic) and a specific weapon or spell.

The program validates user input at each step to guide the user and handle incorrect selections gracefully.

Damage Values
The final damage is calculated by multiplying a base damage of 10 by the bonus value of the chosen weapon or spell.
